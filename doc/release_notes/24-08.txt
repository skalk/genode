Base framework and OS-level infrastructure
##########################################

Cultivation of C++20 programming style
======================================

[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/23.05#New_tool_chain_based_on_GCC_12.3__C__20_enabled_by_default - One year ago],
we enabled C++20 as default. With the current release, we took the chance to
update the codebase according to this version of the standard.

:C++20 function template syntax:
  The 'auto' keyword can be used in many places where template types had to be
  declared manually. We updated all sources of the base framework accordingly.

:Using 'using' instead of 'typedef':
  C-style type aliases are no longer used within the framework.

:util/geometry.h:
  The header has been moved from the os repository to base repository.
  'Point', 'Area', and 'Rect' have been turned into plain compound types,
  making 'x', 'y', 'w', 'h', 'at', and 'area' accessible without a method call.
  'Rect' is now represented as a tuple of 'Point' and 'Area', which is the most
  common form of initialization.
  The companion utilities have been updated ('constexpr', eliminating out parameters)
  as well.

:/util/color.h:
  The 'Color' type has been converted from a class to a POD type by replacing
  the constructors by the named create functions 'rgb', 'clamped_rgb',
  and 'clamped_rgba'. This enables the initialization of color values using
  the '{ .r = ... }' syntax and makes the type usable in const expressions.
  The change also narrows the type for the color components and alpha values to
  'uint8_t'. So possible integer overflows of computed values are detected
  by '-Wconversion'.


Reduced reliance on the C++ exception mechanism
===============================================

In [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/21.11#New_pattern_for_C___error_handling - version 21.11],
we introduced the 'Attempt' pattern as an alternative to exception-based error
handling. While gradually applying this pattern, in particular for new
introduced interfaces, we observed our code becoming more rigid and concrete,
leaving no condition unconsidered. Given this added assurance, we ultimately
decided to remove the reliance on C++ exceptions from the base framework over
time. The current release takes a huge leap in this direction.

:base/id_space.h:
  A new 'Id_space::apply' overload takes a second functor 'missing_fn' as
  argument, which is called whenever the lookup fails. It thereby allows the
  use of the 'Id_space' utility without 'Unknown_id' exceptions.

:util/xml_node.h:
  The two 'Xml_node::attribute' accessors have been removed along with
  the 'Nonexistent_attribute' exception.
  Attributes are generally accessed via the 'attribute_value' method, which
  handles the case via a default value.

:Core RPC interfaces:
  Exceptions have been entirely removed from the RPC interfaces provided
  the core component, namely 'Trace', 'Pd', 'Cpu', 'Rm', 'Region_map'.

  While touching these interfaces, we took the opportunity for modernization
  and consolidation of both the interfaces and their implementation. E.g.,
  core's trace service received a welcome facelift, e.g., the former use of
  basic types got replaced by dedicated types.

  The revised 'Region_map' interface uses an 'Attr' compound struct for
  specifying arguments to the 'attach' operation, which makes the intent of
  client code more obvious. The operation returns a 'Range' instead of a
  'Local_addr' now. The 'Region_map::State' type got renamed to 'Fault'.

:base/child.h:
  The 'Child_policy::Nonexistent_id_space' exception has been removed by
  making the 'server_id_space' mandatory for each policy.
  The former 'Child::Process' and 'Child::Process::Loaded_executable' classes
  got replaced by static functions that return failure conditions as return
  values, eliminating the use of C++ exceptions by the child framework.

The overall ambition of cutting back the use of C++ exceptions is not limited
to the base framework but can be observed for critical components as well.
In particular, the NIC router received a profound rework in this respect.


Tightened GUI-session interface
===============================

On our [https://genode.org/about/road-map - road map], we anticipated
intensive work on user-facing topics, many being related to graphical user
interfaces. While approaching these topics, we sensed that the clean
implementation of our ideas demands a revisit of the framework's existing GUI
infrastructure, in particular the GUI-session interface as provided by the
nitpicker GUI server and the window manager. Note that we barely touched this
corner of the framework in the past ten years since version
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/14.08#New_GUI_architecture - 14.08].
The changes are as follows.

* The 'Gui::Session::session_control' RPC function got removed because its
  functionality has long been superseded by the window manager and layouter.

* The interfaces and components received a thorough coding-style update,
  embracing C++20, avoiding plain pointers, using 'Attr' structs for passing
  attributes, removing the notion of invalid handles/IDs, replacing
  basic types by dedicated types, and removing the use C++ exceptions.

* The out-of-RAM and out-of-caps conditions are now consistently handled by
  the 'Gui::Connection', which does no longer inherit the 'Gui::Session'
  interface and can thereby introduce tailored result types.

* The creation of top-level views and child views are now two distinct
  operations ('view' and 'child_view').

* The access of the subsumed framebuffer and input interfaces is now
  mediated by the plain public members 'Connection::framebuffer' and 'input'.
  This simplifies the client-side code. E.g., '_gui.input()->pending()'
  becomes '_gui.input.pending()'.

* Corner cases of view-stacking operations are now expressed as dedicated
  commands. The new stacking commands are FRONT, BACK, FRONT_OF, and BEHIND_OF.

* View handles are managed as 'Id_space' and hence named view IDs now.
  The allocation of view IDs has been moved from the server side to the
  client, which gives clients more flexibility and reduces the surface of
  possible error conditions between client and server.
  To ease the client-side ID management, the 'Gui::Connection' hosts
  a 'view_ids' ID space for optional use. E.g., the new 'Top_level_view'
  class uses this ID space for ID allocation. This class accommodates the
  most typical use case of opening a single window.

* The creation of new views accepts initial view attributes now,
  which accommodate typical client use cases with less code.


Fostered consistency of naming
==============================

Within our code base, we are ardent about consistency. However, two relics
from the infancy of the project remained standing out like sore thumbs. First,
the '_drv' suffix of driver executables violated our established
[https://genode.org/documentation/developer-resources/conventions - style]
of naming things without artificial abbreviations.
Second, the plural naming of the _<repo>/src/drivers/_ directory used to be
inconsistent with the sibling directories _test/_, _app/_, _server/_.
The current release rectifies both inconsistencies. The '_drv' suffix has been
dropped and the directory has been renamed to _driver/_.


Device drivers
##############

Linux device-driver environment (DDE)
=====================================

We last adapted Linux DDE for kernel 6.1 in May/August 2023. According to
our plan of approximately one update per year, it was time to roll up our
sleeves for the adaption to Linux 6.6 LTS and ready our driver base for
future (especially PC) platforms. With this release, we limited our efforts
to the emulation library itself as well as virt_linux and pc_linux driver
ports.

Thus from now on, PC platforms use Linux driver sources of kernel version
6.6.47 for USB host controllers and devices, Wifi and Ethernet adapters,
Intel display, lxip TCP/IP protocols, and wireguard. Non-x86 platforms were
updated for USB devices and network protocols only, but will be adapted in future
releases step-by-step. All drivers work as drop-in-replacements of older
versions with respect to integration and configuration.

Our Wifi driver port was amended by an online quality update concerning the
currently established connection, which can be enabled by the
'update_quality_interval' configuration attribute. By this feature, user
interfaces are enabled to reflect connection-quality changes almost
instantly. Additionally, we added support for Intel AX200/9560 wireless
adapters and restored support for Wifi devices found in Thinkpad T430
notebooks.

During this release cycle, we analyzed a significant network throughput drop
resp. CPU load increase when using the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/5151 - PC Ethernet driver].
We eventually traced the effect to runtime overhead originating from our DDE
memory allocator and the positive impact of a simple allocation-cache
implementation confirmed our suspicion veritable. Hence, we replaced our
custom allocator by the Linux kernel-internal SLUB allocator that is based
on page/folio allocation. The folio API is well hidden in the kernel
internals, still in flux, and offers only incomplete (resp. outdated)
documentation, which required quite a bit of research efforts reading and
understanding the kernel's implementation.

In the end, we improved our emulation implementation sufficiently and
managed to get the PC NIC driver to work robustly with gigabit performance
and a CPU load reduced by 25-40% on Intel Kaby/Tiger Lake notebooks.


Platform driver
===============

During ACPI suspend, the PCI bridges in the system may forget their
PCI configuration. On resume, this configuration needs to be restored so that
all PCI devices behind the bridge become usable again. With this release, we
added support to the pci_decode component to report all relevant information, which is
then picked up by the platform driver after an ACPI resume to re-configure the used PCI
bridges.


Improvements for NXP's i.MX family
==================================

The current release comprises a lot of updates and additional support for the
i.MX family of devices.

First of all, we have updated all existent Linux driver ports to Linux kernel
version 6.1.20. In detail, these are the drivers for the Freescale Ethernet
Device (FEC) for ARMv7 and ARMv8, the display management for the i.MX 8M Quad
EVK and the MNT Reform 2, as well as the SD-card Host Controller for the same
two boards.

The Gapfruit AG and namely Alice Domage rendered outstanding service to enable
platform support for the i.MX 8M Plus SoC and the Compulab's IOT Gateway, which
is based on it. Beside clock, powering, and reset support by a platform driver
specific to this SoC, support is now available for both Ethernet cards (FEC and
ST Microelectronic' STMMAC), SD-card host controller, I2C, and GPIO.

Genode's custom kernel supports two further boards now, namely the F&S Embedded
armStone Starterkit and MNT Pocket Reform. Both using the i.MX 8M Plus SoC,
mentioned above. The support is limited to the very basics, and no peripherals
apart from CPU and timer are integrated yet.

Since release 21.11 the Pin I/O session interface is available, and shall
replace the older Gpio session interface. By now, for the i.MX SoC's that all
contain the same kind of GPIO controllers, a native driver existed only, which
support the old interface. With this release, we introduce a pin driver
implementing the favored Pin I/O session interface instead. All occurrences in
packages and run-scripts under Genode's umbrella use the new driver now, which
can be found under `src/driver/pin/imx` within the genode-imx repository.
The old driver and the Gpio session interface are still existent. But now, as
there is no hard dependency or necessity for it anymore, we mark the old
driver, as well as the Gpio session interface as being deprecated.

Finally, we moved all remaining i.MX specific parts out of Genode's main
repository into the genode-imx repository to be consistent with the recent
approach of vendor specific external repositories.


Libraries and applications
##########################

    Fixes #5325


Mesa version 24.0.8
===================

With release
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/24.05#Mesa_updated_to_version_24.0.1 - 24.05],
we updated Mesa to major version 24. During the past few
months, we improved the memory allocation and synchronization for Intel's Iris
driver and as a side effect updated Mesa to version 24.0.8.


Platforms
#########

Execution on bare hardware (base-hw)
====================================

Under the hood of Genode's custom kernel the way how CPU-local memory is
arranged changed fundamentally.
The kernel's virtual memory layout now comprises a CPU area. Each CPU has its
own slot within this area, containing kernel stack, CPU object data resp. all
CPU-local data.
This change is transparent to most Genode developers. It was done to ease
CPU detection and bootstrapping at runtime, for kernel stack overflow detection,
and to retrieve the current CPU object by means of the kernel stack pointer.

NOVA microhypervisor
====================

The kernel received support to handle the x86 CPU FPU extension
[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions - AVX], which is a
family of SIMD instruction extensions used for optimized
implementations of mathematical algorithms, e.g., it is used in multimedia
applications. In principle, the kernel has to detect the available AVX versions,
e.g., AVX, AVX-2, AVX-512. Depending on the version, it has to save and restore
additional FPU state during thread switching.
Beside the general availability to Genode applications, the Seoul VMM got
enabled as a first user of the feature. The VMM now announces the AVX feature
to the guest VMs, so that the guest kernel can enable it and guest user
applications can utilize it, e.g., for web browser and video de-/coding
use-cases. The feature got tested with Seoul for Intel and AMD systems.

Additionally, the Genode core roottask now supports Intel SoCs with e-Core
only CPUs, formerly named Intel ATOM CPUs and nowadays branded as Intel
n-Series CPUs.

Finally, the kernel now supports the freeing of vCPU related data structures
during VM destruction, got optimized to reduce resource overhead during cross
CPU IPC and improved VM MSR exit handling.


Build system and tools
######################

Improved reproducibility
========================

The demand for reproducible builds has been increasing during the past few
years. The main hindrance that makes builds unreproducible are timestamps. On
Genode, especially components that produce TAR files suffered from this
limitation, since the date of the archived data was set to the time of
archiving. To avoid this issue, we introduce an customizable global TAR_OPT in
Genode's build system that sets the date of the archived files to the date of
the epoch and the user/group to one. As a starting point, we added the TAR_OPT to
the Qt5-build process while other targets will incrementally follow.

Additionally, we enabled our Rump-kernel port to be reproducible.


Goa SDK
=======

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

After the addition of on-target debugging on Sculpt OS in
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/24.05#On-target_debugging_using_the_GNU_debugger__GDB_ - Genode 24.05],
it was about time to equip Goa with debugging support as well. For this purpose,
the tool received an optional '--debug' command-line switch, which instructs Goa
to consider
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/23.11#Debug_information_for_depot_binaries - dbg archives]
in its download, export and publish steps.

When provided with this switch on 'goa run', the tool also creates a
_<project-name>.gdb_ file in the project's _var/_ directory. This file contains
initialization commands for the GNU debugger (GDB) and can be passed to GDB
via the '--command' argument.

[image goa_gdb_sculpt]

The _Goa testbed_ package and preset have been updated accordingly to make use
of our debug monitor. The default NIC router configuration on Sculpt OS now
comprises an additional _gdb_ domain that is intended to accommodate a single
client to which the router forwards port 9999 of the _uplink_ domain. This is
intended for making the testbed's debug monitor available as a remote GDB target.
Note that these changes will become effective with the next Sculpt release.
In the meantime, you may cherry-pick the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/commit/aeb42b0983143e6fe0a01f7f5316612709da1a9d - corresponding commit].

Along with debugging support, Goa also received a '--with-backtrace' switch and
a 'backtrace' command. The former instructs the tool to preserve frame-pointer
information by supplying the '-fno-omit-frame-pointer' flag to GCC. The
'goa backtrace' command is a shortcut for 'goa run --debug --with-backtrace' that
additionally passes the log output to our
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/24.02#Convenient_parsing_of_backtraces - backtrace tool].

For detailed instructions, please refer to the corresponding
[https://genodians.org/jschlatow/2024-07-31-goa-gdb - Genodians article].


Meson build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects like Qemu, glib, and Mesa have switched to the Python based
[https://mesonbuild.com - Meson] build system. Mesa, for example, produces a
large number of generated C/C++ files using Meson features. In order to ease the
porting effort of Meson based projects to Genode, we have added basic support for
this build system to Goa.

A Meson project can be built and executed like any other Goa-supported build
system with the addition that there can be a _meson_args_ file (analogously to
_cmake_args_ for CMake) where additional arguments can be passed to the meson
command. Otherwise, Goa will look for a _meson.build_ file in the _src_
directory, which identifies the projects build system as Meson.

As a simple test, you can checkout the _hello_meson_ example in the _examples_
directory of Goa.

At the current stage, only binary targets for the x86_64 architecture are supported by
Goa/Meson. Shared libraries and ARM support will be addressed next.


Rust & Cargo
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From Rust 1.77 onward, the binary distribution of the _std_ library
('x86_64-unknown-freebsd') assumes that the underlying OS kernel supports
thread-local storage via the FS segment register on x86.
As Genode does not provide a TLS area via FS, TLS accesses by the library
would end up in invalid memory, which renders the binary version of
the std library unusable on Genode.
In response, we have implemented a custom Genode target profile for Rust, which
allows us to still leverage the FreeBSD port of Rust's standard library while
using the _emulated_ TLS model. In order to compile the parts of the std
library used by an application for the custom profile, we have moved to using
a _nightly_ Rust tool chain. For detailed instructions for setting up the
tool chain, head over to the
