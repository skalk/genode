This repository contains the device-driver environment (DDE) for the
"donator OS" iPXE available from http://ipxe.org/.

For building DDE iPXE, you first need to fetch and patch the original
sources. The 'prepare_port' tool automates this task. Just issue:

! ./tool/ports/prepare_port dde_ipxe

Now, you need to include the DDE iPXE repository into your Genode
build configuration by adding the path to this directory to the
'REPOSITORIES' declaration of the 'etc/build.conf' file within your
build directory, for example

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/dde_ipxe

After a successful build the DDE iPXE based ethernet driver is located
at 'bin/ipxe_nic_drv'.

The driver optionally reports the following information under the
label "devices" if requested in the config as depicted.

! <config> <report mac_address="true"/> </config>

! <devices> <nic mac_address="02:00:00:00:00:01"/> </devices>
