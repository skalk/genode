USB HID driver
##############

Supports keyboard and mouse connected via USB. It drives one or multiple devices
depending on the provided ones in its USB sessions and reports input events to an
event session. A run script can be found under 'run/usb_hid_raw.run'.


Keyboard LED handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The state of the keyboard LEDs like capslock can be controlled by providing
a corresponding ROM to the driver and configure it appropriately:

!...
!<config capslock_led="rom" numlock_led="rom" scrlock_led="rom"/>
!...
