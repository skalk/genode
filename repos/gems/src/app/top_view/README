This component obtains CPU utilization information about the existing trace
subjects from core's "TRACE" service and generates output about the highest
CPU consumer per CPU in percentage. The output may be provided via the LOG
session or as a Report consumable by the menu_view component.

Configuration
-------------

The interval of output generation can be defined via the 'period_ms' attribute
of the '<config>' node.

The following example shows the default values.

! <config period_ms="5000" log="yes" report="no"/>
