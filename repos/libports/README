This directory contains ports of 3rd-party libraries to Genode.


Usage
-----

The tool './tool/ports/prepare_port' in the toplevel directory automates the
task of downloading and preparing the 3rd-party source codes. One can select
individual ports that have to be prepared by specifying their base names
(without the version number) as command-line argument. For example, the
following command prepares both the C library and the Freetype library:
! ./tool/ports/prepare_port libc freetype

To compile and link against 3rd-party libraries of the 'libports' repository,
you have to include the repository into the build process by appending it to the
'REPOSITORIES' declaration of your '<build-dir>/etc/build.conf' file.


Under the hood
--------------

For each library, there is a file contained in the 'libports/ports/'
subdirectory. The file is named after the library and contains the
library-specific rules for downloading the source code and installing header
files.


How does 'libports' relate to the other repositories?
-----------------------------------------------------

Most libraries hosted in the 'libports' repository expect a complete C
library, which is provided via the 'libc' port. The libc, in turn, depends on
the 'os' repository for its back end.
